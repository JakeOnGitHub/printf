.SH NAME
.B _printf 
-\ Formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
Prints to standard output under the control of a 
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. 
.SH Return value
With successful return, functions return the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte.

If an output error, a negative value is returned.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string consists of 0 or more directives (ordinary characters that are not %), that are copied to the output. The format string consists of conversion specifications, which result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by with % and ends with the conversion specifier.
The argument corresponds properly with the conversion specifier. All arguments are used in the order given.
.SH The conversion specifier
Character that specifies the applied conversion type. Conversion specifiers and meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char and the converted character is printed.
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is a pointer to an array of character type. Characters in the array are written up to the (but do not include the) null byte.
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'
.SH EXAMPLE
Print the day of the year, with day of the week and month are pointers to strings and day and year are integers:
